                <h3>Causes of this could be:</h3>
                <ul class="w3-ul w3-black">
                    <li>The port isn't open</li>
                    <li>The website isn't online</li>
                    <li>The server has you as an blacklisted IP address (Very unlikely)</li>
                    <li>The server is so busy helping everyone else, you got lost in the crowd. (The server is being overworked)</li>
                    <li>Firewalls</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What to do:</h3>
                <ul class="w3-ul w3-white">
                    <li>Open up the firewalls</li>
                    <li>Wait and try again later</li>
                    <li>If you're really determined, try to find the owner of the websites email (through <a href="https://lookup.icann.org" target="_blank">ICANN Lookup</a>*)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="w3-small">*Sometimes, a website is protected by "Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc." This is when the website owner does not want to be looked up, or their information not to be made public. Under these circumstances, all you can do is just wait patiently.</div>
